# FlatPFA

This is a cosmetic fork of Piano From Above by Brian Pantano which aims to make the software look... well... flat.

There are two versions/branches of this. One is the normal modification of PFA and the second is the same visual mod but with the performance improvements from khang06's viz branch which can be found here: https://github.com/khang06/PianoFromAbove .
